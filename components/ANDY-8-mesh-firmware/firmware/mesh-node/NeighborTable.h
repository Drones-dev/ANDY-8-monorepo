  Direct-neighbor tracking

  A neighbor is another node whose HELLO packet this radio received directly.
  The table does not assume every drone can hear every other drone, and it does
  not add nodes merely because another node mentioned them. That distinction is
  important for future route selection because RSSI/SNR describe only a direct
  radio link.
